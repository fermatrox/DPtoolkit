Run pytest for the module or file I'm currently working on.

1. Determine which module/file I was just editing
2. Run the corresponding tests with verbose output and coverage
3. Show any failing tests with full error messages
4. Report coverage percentage and list uncovered lines
5. If coverage is below 80%, suggest what tests to add
